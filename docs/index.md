# Modeling 2018

## How to collaborate
### Using Git
This notes are saved into a Git repository. If you know how to use Git, feel free to use it:

    git clone git@github.com:michogar/modeling.git
    cd modeling

make changes and`

    git commit -a
    git push

### Without using Git
A simple way to collaborate is downloading notes from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michogar/modeling/master/docs/apuntes.md).
Then you can modify whatever you want and after that, send the `apuntes.md` file
to `michogar at gmail dot com` with the subject [MODELING] in the mail.

## Markdown
Notes are writting in Markdown. There is a lot of tutorials on the web about this.

To learn a bit about Markdown you can:

* Do a online tutorial about it [www.markdowntutorial.com](https://www.markdowntutorial.com)
* Read a bit about it [Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
